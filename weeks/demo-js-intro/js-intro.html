# ~ Introduction to Javascript ~

class: middle

## Why Javascript?
With HTML and CSS, the code we write is relatively static once we hit save and load it in the browser.

We've learned how to add animation and limited interactivity, but even with these advance uses, our code is
still fixed and only can respond in predetermined ways.

---
class: middle

Javascript enables you to consider a new temporal dimension of a webpage — the time before, during and after a page loads —
and add dynamic and complex interactions.

---
class: middle two-column

With javascript we can:
 + add/remove classes
 + add/remove html elements
 + change the contents of elements
 + change the style of elements
 + add mouse, keyboard, and other interactive features
 + load additional resources


and so much <span id="more">more</span>

<script type="text/javascript">
  const moreSpan = document.querySelector('#more');
  let counter = 0;
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    moreSpan.innerText = moreSpan.innerText + 'e';
    ++counter;
    if (counter > 300) {
      clearInterval(interval);
    }
  }, 150);
</script>

---
class: middle

## How to use Javascript
Similar to how we use CSS, javascript can be used embedded or linked

#### embedded
```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  console.log('hi class~');
</script>
```

#### external
```html
<script src="example.js" type="text/javascript" defer></script>
```

Like with CSS, the `external` approach is the best way to use javascript.

Some basics:
```js
// this is a comment!
/* this is a
   multiline
   comment */

// this writes a message to the developer console
// which can be useful for debugging your code!
console.log('hi everyone~');

// a bit old school, this will create an alert box
alert('hi everyone!!');
```
<script type="text/javascript">
  console.log('hi class~');
  alert('hi class!!');
</script>

Unlike HTML and CSS, Javascript is a `programming language`.

Generally speaking HTML and CSS exist to express how to structure and display content.
Javascript and other programming languages are like lists of instructions to be carried out.

Javascript is the programming language we use with web browsers, but there are [hundreds of programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages)
in existence.

Most programming languages share a set of foundational principles. Once you understand these principles, it
can be easier to learn a new programming language.

---
class: middle

## How do we talk to computers?
Let's go over some of these foundational principles we'll use a lot.

---
class: middle

#### Variables
A variable is a container for a value that we can use throughout our code.
We define a variable by using the `let` keyword in front of it.
```js
// variables can be any name you want..
// so long as they are only made up of letters!
let myVariable = 'hi';

// this won't work
let my variables = 'hi';

// nor will this!!
let my-variable = 'hi';

// try to avoid this
let my2ndVariable = 'hi';

// this is ok, but javascript convention is to use "bumpy" case
let my_variable = 'hi';
```
Like CSS, we end each line with a semicolon (`;`)

---
class: middle

Variables can hold lots of different values.. like `strings` and `numbers`:
```js
let myNumber = 10;
// we can use console.log to see the variable in the console
console.log(myNumber);

let anotherVariable = 'hello';
console.log(anotherVariable);

// we can reuse a variable once we've created it!
// note that we don't re-define it with `let` before
// since it already exists
anotherVariable = 'ho';
console.log(anotherVariable);

// here we're adding together the string "hi" to
// our `anotherVariable` that is equal to "ho"
let offToWorkWeGo = 'hi ' + anotherVariable;
console.log(offToWorkWeGo);
```
<script type="text/javascript">
console.log(10);

let anotherVariable = 'hi';
// we can use console.log to see the variable in the console
console.log(anotherVariable);

// we can reuse a variable once we've created it!
anotherVariable = 'ho';
console.log(anotherVariable);

// here we're adding together the string "hi" to
// our `anotherVariable` that is equal to "ho"
let offToWorkWeGo = 'hi ' + anotherVariable;
console.log(offToWorkWeGo);
</script>

### Values vocabulary
There are several ways values can be represented in code, what we refer to as `types`.

---
class: middle

#### strings
A `string` is a piece of text wrapped in either `''` single or `""` double quotes. Strings are made
up of characters (like the `a` in "apple"). These sequences of characters *strung* together comprise a `string` <span class="rotate-90">: )</span>

```js
let haiku = 'New snowfall / onion sprouts / mark the path';

// make sure that the text within doesn't break it
haiku = 'If you're and oak / you don't pretend / you are a flower';
            // ^ the string would end here

// you can escape quotes...
let quote = "\"ribbit,\" croaked the frog.";
          // ^ you can escape quotes with a forward slash

```

---
class: middle

#### booleans
A `boolean` is a value that is either `true` or `false`. They can act as a toggle or flag, and
are the value that conditionals check for.

```js
let isItNightOut = true;

let isTheSunUp = false;
```

---
class: middle

#### Conditionals
A `conditional` is a way that we can ask a question and do different things based on the answer.
Conditionals are written with an **`if` statement** with the question wrapped in parentheses `()` and
the code to run if the question is true in `{ ... }` curly brackets:
```js
let isItNightOut = true;

if (isItNightOut) {
  // add stars to our website's background
}

let name = 'goose';

if (name == 'goose') {
  console.log('run!!!');
}
```
<script type="text/javascript">
let name = 'goose';

if (name == 'goose') {
  console.log('run!!!');
}
</script>

---
class: middle two-column

Often we use conditionals to compare one value to another. The way we compare values is with `Comparison Operators`.
In the last example we used the `==` comparator, which asks is the value on the left is the same as the value on the right.

```js
let name = 'goose';

if (name == 'goose') {
  console.log('run!!!');
}
```

Common comparison operators are:
+ `==` is exactly equal
+ `!=` is not exactly euqal
+ `>` is greater than
+ `<` is less than
+ `>=` is greater than or equal
+ `<=` is less than or equal

---
class: middle

Extending our last example, let's also add a condition for when the question isn't `true`.
```js
let name = 'duck';

if (name == 'goose') {
  console.log('run!!!');
} else {
  console.log('whew!');
}
```
Here we add an `else` condition, for when the first conditional question isn't true.

<script type="text/javascript">
let name = 'duck';

if (name == 'goose') {
  console.log('run!!!');
} else {
  console.log('whew!');
}
</script>

---
class: middle fix-multiline fix-again-ugh

There's a third way to control the flow of your conditionals, with the **`else if` statement**:
```js
/* eggs:
  0 0 0 0 0 0
  0 0 0 0 0 0
*/

let guess = 8;

// how many eggs do we have?
if (guess < 12) {
  console.log("you're under!");
} else if (guess > 12) {
  console.log("you're over!");
} else if (guess == 12) {
  console.log("bingo!");
}
```
This allows you to chain together multiple conditionals or questions in order to handle more cases.

<script type="text/javascript">
let guess = 8;
console.log("You guessed: " + guess);

// how many eggs do we have?
if (guess < 12) {
  console.log("you're under!");
} else if (guess > 12) {
  console.log("you're over!");
} else if (guess == 12) {
  console.log("bingo!");
}
</script>

```js
/*   __//
    /.__.\
    \ \/ /
 '__/    \
  \-      )
   \_____/   -cf
_____|_|____ */

let eggs = '0000000000000000000000';

let guess = window.prompt("Guess how many eggs? 0000000000000000000000");
console.log("You guessed: " + guess);

// how many eggs do we have?
if (guess < eggs.length || guess > eggs.length) {
  console.log("you're wrong!");
} else if (guess == eggs.length) {
  console.log("bingo!");
}

// or could be written:
if (guess == eggs.length) {
  console.log("bingo!");
} else {
  console.log("you're wrong!");
}
```

<script type="text/javascript">
let eggs = '0000000000000000000000';
let guess = window.prompt("Guess how many eggs? 0000000000000000000000");
console.log("You guessed: " + guess);

// how many eggs do we have?
if (guess < eggs.length || guess > eggs.length) {
  console.log("you're wrong!");
} else if (guess == eggs.length) {
  console.log("bingo!");
}
</script>

class: middle

#### A quick note about spacing
The formatting of certain items in javascript is flexible:
```js
// this is valid
if(1==1){
  console.log('yeah, good. OK.');
}
```
<script type="text/javascript">
  console.log('yeah, good. OK.');
</script>

But certain conventions have been established to ensure things remain readable and consistent.
The convention for writing conditionals is to put a space after the `if`, around operators, and before the curly:
```js
if (1 == 1) {
```
This isn't a necessity, but a good habit to get into. <span class="rotate-90">: )</span>

---
class: middle

#### Functions
Functions are a powerful concept that most programming languages employ.

They allow us to set aside a group of instructions or code to execute at some later point.

Functions are composed by specifying the `function` keyword and then providing a custom name for your `function`.
The name is how we will later refer to it.

```js
function myFirstFunction() {
  // code to run later when we call the function goes in here
}
```
at some later point...
```js
myFirstFunction(); // lets call our function
```

---
class: middle

Functions can optionally receive additional details, called `arguments`, to make
them more useful:

```js
function sayHi() {
  console.log('Hi Josephine.');
}
sayHi();
sayHi(); // say hi again
```

Instead of making the message we write to console fixed, we could use an `argument` to
make the message we write dynamic:

```js
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log('oh, hello ' + name);
}
sayHello('Josephine');
sayHello('Maryam'); // say hello to someone new
```

`arguments` within a `function` are `variables` that only exist within the `scope` or context
of the function.

<script type="text/javascript">
function sayHi() {
  console.log('Hi Josephine.');
}
sayHi();

function sayHello(name) {
  console.log('oh, hello ' + name);
}
sayHello('Josephine');
sayHello('Maryam');
</script>

---
class: middle

An important aspect of functions is that they help break up our code so that we don't
have to repeat ourselves by copying and pasting code.

So if you find yourself copying and pasting the same code over and over to acheive some goal,
it might be a great opprotunity to use a function.

---
class: middle

Another useful thing functions can do is send back a *value* from the code it contains.
We use the `return` keyword to send back some value to the place where it was called.

```js
function scream(text){
  return text.toUpperCase() + '!!!!';
}

let shouting = scream('hello everyone');
console.log(shouting);
console.log(scream("I hope you're enjoying this js intro 😅"));
```
So we can define a list of instructions that we might need to repeat often, call it at
whatever point we want, but also return some result from that work to use.

<script type="text/javascript">
function scream(text){
  return text.toUpperCase() + '!!!!';
}

let shouting = scream('hello class!');
console.log(shouting);
console.log(scream('I hope this is all making sense 😅'));
</script>

Those are the basics to getting started with javascript.
In part II we'll cover the DOM, user events, and making changes to your&nbsp;webpages.

    </textarea>
    <script src="/assets/js/remark-latest.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      var slideshow = remark.create({ ratio: '4:3', navigation: { scroll: false }});

      // run any script tags contained within the active slide
      slideshow.on('afterShowSlide', (slide) => {
        var scripts = document.querySelector('.remark-visible').querySelectorAll('script');
        for (var script of scripts) {
          setTimeout(() => {
            eval(script.innerText);
          }, 100);
        }
      });

      var links = document.links;

      for (var i = 0, linksLength = links.length; i < linksLength; i++) {
         if (links[i].hostname != window.location.hostname) {
             links[i].target = '_blank';
         }
      }
