# ~ Introduction to Javascript ~

---
class: middle

## Why Javascript?
With HTML and CSS, the code we write is relatively static once we hit save and load it in the browser.

We've learned how to add animation and limited interactivity, but even with these advance uses, our code is
still fixed and only can respond in predetermined ways.

---
class: middle

Javascript enables you to consider a new temporal dimension of a webpage — the time before, during and after a page loads —
and add dynamic and complex interactions.

---
class: middle two-column

With javascript we can:
 + add/remove classes
 + add/remove html elements
 + change the contents of elements
 + change the style of elements
 + add mouse, keyboard, and other interactive features
 + load additional resources


and so much <span id="more">more</span>

<script type="text/javascript">
  const moreSpan = document.querySelector('#more');
  let counter = 0;
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    moreSpan.innerText = moreSpan.innerText + 'e';
    ++counter;
    if (counter > 300) {
      clearInterval(interval);
    }
  }, 150);
</script>

---
class: middle

## How to use Javascript
Similar to how we use CSS, javascript can be used embedded or externally

#### embedded
```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  console.log('hi everyone~');
</script>
```

#### external
```html
<script src="example.js" type="text/javascript" defer></script>
```

Like with CSS, the `external` approach is the best way to use javascript.

---
class: middle fix-multiline

Some basics:
```js
// this is a comment!
/* this is a
   multiline
   comment */

// this writes a message to the developer console
// which can be useful for debugging our code!
console.log('hi everyone~');

// a bit old school, this will create an alert box
alert('hi everyone!!');
```
<script type="text/javascript">
  console.log('hi everyone~');
  alert('hi everyone!!');
</script>


---
class: middle

Unlike HTML and CSS, Javascript is a `programming language`.

Generally speaking HTML and CSS exist to express how to structure and display content.
Javascript and other programming languages are like lists of instructions to be carried out.

Javascript is the programming language we use with web browsers, but there are [hundreds of programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages)
in existence.

Most programming languages share a set of foundational principles. Once you understand these principles, it
can be easier to learn a new programming language.

---
class: middle

## How do we talk to computers?
Let's go over some of these foundational principles we'll use a lot.

---
class: middle

#### Variables
A variable is a container for a value that we can use throughout our code.
We define a variable by using the `let` keyword in front of it.
```js
// variables can be any name you want..
// so long as they are only made up of letters!
let myVariable = 'hi';

// this won't work
let my variables = 'hi';

// nor will this!!
let my-variable = 'hi';

// try to avoid this
let my2ndVariable = 'hi';

// this is ok, but javascript convention is to use "bumpy" case
let my_variable = 'hi';
```
Like CSS, we end each line with a semicolon (`;`)

---
class: middle

You may see code that uses `var` to create variables. This is also an acceptable
way to create them, but `let` is a newer way that comes with some advantages.

---
class: middle

Variables can hold lots of different values.. like `strings` and `numbers`:
```js
let myNumber = 10;
// we can use console.log to see the variable in the console
console.log(myNumber);

let anotherVariable = 'hello';
console.log(anotherVariable);

// we can reuse a variable once we've created it!
// note that we don't re-define it with `let` before
// since it already exists
anotherVariable = 'ho';
console.log(anotherVariable);

// here we're adding together the string "hi" to
// our `anotherVariable` that is equal to "ho"
let offToWorkWeGo = 'hi ' + anotherVariable;
console.log(offToWorkWeGo);
```
<script type="text/javascript">
console.log(10);

let anotherVariable = 'hello';
// we can use console.log to see the variable in the console
console.log(anotherVariable);

// we can reuse a variable once we've created it!
anotherVariable = 'ho';
console.log(anotherVariable);

// here we're adding together the string "hi" to
// our `anotherVariable` that is equal to "ho"
let offToWorkWeGo = 'hi ' + anotherVariable;
console.log(offToWorkWeGo);
</script>

---
class: middle

### Values vocabulary
There are several ways values can be represented in code, what we refer to as `types`.

---
class: middle

#### strings
A `string` is a piece of text wrapped in either `''` single or `""` double quotes. Strings are made
up of characters (like the `a` in "apple"). These sequences of characters *strung* together comprise a `string` <span class="rotate-90">: )</span>

```js
let haiku = 'New snowfall / onion sprouts / mark the path';

// make sure that the text within doesn't break it
haiku = 'If you're and oak / you don't pretend / you are a flower';
            // ^ the string would end here

// you can escape quotes...
let quote = "\"ribbit,\" croaked the frog.";
          // ^ you can escape quotes with a forward slash

```

---
class: middle

#### booleans
A `boolean` is a value that is either `true` or `false`. They can act as a toggle or flag, and
are the value that conditionals check for.

```js
let isItNightOut = true;

let isTheSunUp = false;
```

---
class: middle

#### Conditionals
A `conditional` is a way that we can ask a question and do different things based on the answer.
Conditionals are written with an **`if` statement** with the question wrapped in parentheses `()` and
the code to run if the question is true in `{ ... }` curly brackets:
```js
let isItNightOut = true;

if (isItNightOut) {
  // add stars to our website's background
}

let name = 'goose';

if (name == 'goose') {
  console.log('run!!!');
}
```
<script type="text/javascript">
let name = 'goose';

if (name == 'goose') {
  console.log('run!!!');
}
</script>

---
class: middle two-column

Often we use conditionals to compare one value to another. The way we compare values is with `Comparison Operators`.
In the last example we used the `==` comparator, which asks if the value on the left is the same as the value on the right.

```js
let name = 'goose';

if (name == 'goose') {
  console.log('run!!!');
}
```

Common comparison operators are:
+ `==` is exactly equal
+ `!=` is not exactly euqal
+ `>` is greater than
+ `<` is less than
+ `>=` is greater than or equal
+ `<=` is less than or equal

---
class: middle

Extending our last example, let's also add a condition for when the question isn't `true`.
```js
let name = 'duck';

if (name == 'goose') {
  console.log('run!!!');
} else {
  console.log('whew!');
}
```
Here we add an `else` condition, for when the first conditional question isn't true.

<script type="text/javascript">
let name = 'duck';

if (name == 'goose') {
  console.log('run!!!');
} else {
  console.log('whew!');
}
</script>

---
class: middle fix-multiline fix-again-ugh

There's a third way to control the flow of our conditionals, with the **`else if` statement**:
```js
/* eggs:
  0 0 0 0 0 0
  0 0 0 0 0 0
*/

let guess = 8;

// how many eggs do we have?
if (guess < 12) {
  console.log("you're under!");
} else if (guess > 12) {
  console.log("you're over!");
} else if (guess == 12) {
  console.log("bingo!");
}
```
This allows you to chain together multiple conditionals or questions in order to handle more cases.

<script type="text/javascript">
let guess = 8;
console.log("You guessed: " + guess);

// how many eggs do we have?
if (guess < 12) {
  console.log("you're under!");
} else if (guess > 12) {
  console.log("you're over!");
} else if (guess == 12) {
  console.log("bingo!");
}
</script>

---
class: middle

#### A quick note about spacing
The formatting of certain items in javascript is flexible:
```js
// this is valid
if(1==1){
  console.log('yeah, good. OK.');
}
```
<script type="text/javascript">
  console.log('yeah, good. OK.');
</script>

But certain conventions have been established to ensure things remain readable and consistent.
The convention for writing conditionals is to put a space after the `if`, around operators, and before the curly:
```js
if (1 == 1) {
```
This isn't a necessity, but a good habit to get into. <span class="rotate-90">: )</span>


---
class: middle

#### Functions
Functions are a powerful concept that most programming languages employ.

They allow us to set aside a group of instructions or code to execute at some later point.

Functions are composed by specifying the `function` keyword and then providing a custom name for our `function`.
The name is how we will later refer to it.

```js
function myFirstFunction() {
  // code to run later when we call the function goes in here
}
```
at some later point...
```js
myFirstFunction(); // lets call our function
```

---
class: middle

Functions can optionally receive additional details, called `arguments`, to make
them more useful:

```js
function sayHi() {
  console.log('Hi Josephine.');
}
sayHi();
sayHi(); // say hi again
```

Instead of making the message we write to console fixed, we could use an `argument` to
make the message we write dynamic:

```js
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log('oh, hello ' + name);
}
sayHello('Josephine');
sayHello('Maryam'); // say hello to someone new
```

`arguments` within a `function` are `variables` that only exist within the `scope` or context
of the function.

<script type="text/javascript">
function sayHi() {
  console.log('Hi Josephine.');
}
sayHi();
sayHi();

function sayHello(name) {
  console.log('oh, hello ' + name);
}
sayHello('Josephine');
sayHello('Maryam');
</script>

---
class: middle

When writing code we often interact with functions that are a part of other code we don't see.

For instance, the `string` type we covered earlier has [a lot of different functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#instance_methods) we
can all on it.

These functions that are a part of other code are called `methods`.

We call these functions that are a part of some other code with `dot notation`:
```js
let myText = "I'm totally not confused by all this! 😅";
console.log(myText);
myText = myText.toUpperCase();
            // ^ here we're using dot notation to access the
            //   toUpperCase() function that's a part of strings..
console.log("I said...", myText);
```

<script type="text/javascript">
  let myText = "I'm totally not confused by all this! 😅";
  console.log(myText);
  myText = myText.toUpperCase();
  console.log("I said...", myText);
</script>

---
class: middle

In the second javascript intro video we'll be talking more about what the DOM is...

But today let's preview a few ways we can interact with a web page with javascript.

---
class: middle

### Interacting with html: `querySelector`

The main way we can intereact with our html is with the `querySelector` method.

As the name suggests, `querySelector` is a tool to _query_ or search our page by a css _selector_.

We want to query or search throughout our whole page, also know as the `document`:
```js
let myDiv = document.querySelector('#my-blog');
```

```html
<main id="blog">
  ...
</main>
```

---
class: middle

example.js:
```js
let blogElement = document.querySelector('#blog');
console.log('my blog element:', blogElement);
```
example.html:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <script src="example.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
      <main id="blog">
        <h1>My Blog</h1>
      </main>
  </body>
</html>
```
...wait why does it say `null`? `null` is a value that is returned When
something isn't found..

<script type="text/javascript">
  let blogElement = document.querySelector('#blog');
  console.log('my blog element:',blogElement);
</script>
---
class: middle

Since our javascript is executed line by line as the html document is `parsed` the `#blog` div doesn't exist
at the time the `querySelector` line is executed..

The document parsed these lines one by one
```html
<!-- 1 --><!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- 2 --><html lang="en" dir="ltr">
<!-- 3 -->  <head>
<!-- 4 -->    <meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- 5 -->    <script src="example.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

and then moved to our js file:
```js
/* 6 */ let blogElement = document.querySelector('#blog');
/* 7 */ console.log('my blog element:', blogElement);
```

---
class: middle

There are two common solutions to this problem...
either move our code that selects elements after those elements have been parsed:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
  </head>
  <body>
      <main id="blog"></main>
  </body>
  <script src="example.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</html>
```
<main id="blog-exp">
  <h1>My Blog</h1>
</main>

---
class: middle

Or more simply, add the `defer` attribute to our script tag to tell the browser to apply our Javascript
code after the page has been completely parsed.

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <script src="example.js" type="text/javascript" defer></script>
</head>
```
**note** this will only work for externally loaded files. Embded javascript, you'll need to place
the script tag after the body or use other techniques we'll learn more about later..

Another reason to use external scripts <span class="rotate-90">: )</span>

---
class: middle

example.js:
```js
let blogElement = document.querySelector('#blog');
console.log('my blog element:', blogElement);
```
example.html:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <script src="example.js" type="text/javascript" defer></script>
  </head>
  <body>
      <main id="blog">]
        <h1>My Blog</h1>
      </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

<main id="blog-1">
  <h1>My Blog</h1>
</main>
<script type="text/javascript">
  let blogElement = document.querySelector('#blog-1');
  console.log('my blog element:', blogElement);
</script>

---
class: middle

Now that we have a reference to our element in javascript, we can do something with it
like adding a class:
```css
.red {
  color: red;
}
```
The `classList` attribute of a html element in javascript provides tools for adding, removing, and checking
whether an element has a class.

```js
let blogElement = document.querySelector('#blog-2');
blogElement.classList.add('red');
```

<main id="blog-2">
  <h1>My Blog</h1>
</main>

<script type="text/javascript">
  let blogElement = document.querySelector('#blog-2');
  blogElement.classList.add('red');
</script>

---
class: middle

Where this can become more interesting is when we connect changes to user interactions, like clicking..

---
class: middle

We _listen_ for these user events with the `addEventListener` method of an element we've selected with
`querySelector`.

`addEventListener` takes two arguments, the event you want to _listen_ for and then what
function you want to run when that event happens:

```js
function showSurprise() {
  console.log('surprise!');
}

let paragraph = document.querySelector('#my-text');
paragraph.addEventListener('click', showSurprise);
    // note here we don't include the () here  ^
    // that would call the function right away
    // instead we just supply the name alone...
```

```html
<p id="my-text">
  click here for a surprise :)
</p>

```

<p id="my-text" style="font-size: 18px;">
  click here for a surprise :)
</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
  let paragraph = document.querySelector('#my-text');
  paragraph.addEventListener('click', function () {
    console.log('surprise!');
  });
</script>

In <strong>part II</strong> we'll cover the DOM, more user events, and other ways to make changes to our&nbsp;webpages.
