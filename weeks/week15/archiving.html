## putting online, documenting, and archiving your work

## Putting your work online

The first step of hosting your work is setting up a `server` online.

Servers are simply computers connected to the internet. When you sign up for a hosting service your essentially
paying to use a part of a computer, that the company manages, to store and display your files to internet visitors.

There are tons of different hosting services, a few common ones you'll see:
- [digital ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com)
- [linode](https://linode.com)
- [dreamhost](https://dreamhost.com)
- [nearlyfreespeech](https://nearlyfreespeech.com)

---
class: middle

Let's look at using [nearlyfreespeech.com](https://nearlyfreespeech.com)


---
class: middle

Now that we have a server set up on [nearlyfreespeech.com](https://nearlyfreespeech.com), let's upload our code to it.

To upload code, we need to use a special tool to transfer our files from our local computer to the server (computer hosted "in the cloud").

One way we can do that is with an SFTP (secure file transfer protocol) client like [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io)

---
class: middle

Now that we have our site with our work set up on [nearlyfreespeech.com](https://nearlyfreespeech.com) the next step is to buy a domain
name to point to our server. That way we can share our work with others using a URL of our choosing -- called a `domain name`.

After registering this domain name, the last step is to point our URL to our server. The way we do that is by setting the `DNS` (domain name system) address to our server on nearlyfreespeech.

DNS is like a big address book, directing users on the internet how to go from a URL to a server. Whenever you load a URL in
your browser, it first looks at this DNS address book to find exactly where on the internet the server for that site lives.

This server address is called an `IP address` or Internet Protocol address. They looks like this: `173.255.233.187`


---
class: middle

There are bunches of services that handle domain registration and DNS settings. One that I use often is called [namecheap](https://namecheap.com)


---
class: middle

Now that we've set up a server, registered a domain name, and pointed that domain name to our server address, we should be
able to see our site!

## Documenting your work

One of the most important steps in preserving and future proofing your work
is to add documentation to your javascript, html, and css.

Use comments to note what functions or particularly dense sections of code do. Add comments
to you html and css to help explain why you are using certain elements or selectors for.

It's easiest to do this as you're coding&mdash; but some documentation at the end
of the project is better than nothing.

When you return to the project months or years later, it'll be so much easier to
pick up and fix anything that might have stopped working with documentation.

---
class: middle

A few of the following strategies might be obvious.. but there are still
lots of little details that can improve your documentation.

---
class: middle

### Screenshots

In addition to adding text documentation to your project, you should
take high quality screenshots of a selection of site views.

A few things to consider when creating screenshots:
+ Do you want to include the browser chrome? This can help date and add
context to your screenshot.
+ If you're using a Mac, the baked in dropshadow can make it harder to work with the
  images in the future. (cmd + shit + 4 and then press space)
+ Firefox has a built in [screenshot utility](https://screenshots.firefox.com/) that can take screenshots of elements
  or a whole page.
+ Give the files a meaningful name. Use a naming scheme aka `PUCD_Final_<n>.png` and store them together so that they're easier
  to locate in the future.

### screen recordings

Along with screenshots, screen recordings can be really useful to showcase both the design and interactions in a controlled setting.

.pect-50[![Quicktime](assets/screen-rec.png)]

Quicktime has a nice screen recording utility. Practice a few times and then make a recording.

---
class: middle

If you'd like to display it online, keep the full quality version and use a program like [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) to
make a lower resolution copy for web publishing.

It can also be useful to make a series of videos demonstrating different aspects of the site instead of one long video.

### link rot and the case for web archiving

.pect-100[![link rot](assets/linkrotted.png)]

---
class: middle

While things online might seem to provide the sense of endless connectivity and availability, the web
is a fragile and interdependent system.

One of most fundamental and first things we learned were links. Links to other sites, images, videos, javascript files, apis..

We build our websites often with deep dependencies on other sites and resources online.

---
class: middle

These resources we rely on are exceedingly susceptible to disappearing:

.pect-100[![Link Rot](assets/linkrot.jpg)]


.footnote[Graphic from <a href="https://perma.cc">perma.cc</a>]

---
class: middle

Sometimes it's easy to recover or fix `link rot`. But other times, like when
a weather API you relied on for a project shuts down, there isn't much you can do,
other than find a new API (if you're lucky) and rewrite your code...

That's why it's essential to `archive` your work in addition to documenting it.

Web archives preserve and afford the presentation of your site in the exact way it first functioned
for long long time*.

.footnote[*In the archives world, we refrain projecting stability eternally... and you should always be critical of a tool or service does.]

---
class: middle

Beyond link rot, it's also important to web archive your projects to preserve the way you intended them look and function.

When you hand over a site you designed or built to a client, they'll inevitably make changes or alter it in ways
that might compromise your original vision.

Or browsers might deprecate a technology you utilized, like Flash.

...or you might just want to save a [beautiful accident](https://webrecorder.io/_embed/m4rk3r/cool-old-web/20150313041327/http://www.sewingandembroiderywarehouse.com/embtrb.htm) before it's [fixed or removed.](https://www.sewingincanada.com/troubleshooting/)

### How, and who, is Archiving?

---
class: middle

## The Internet Archive

The Internet Archive is one of the earliest and most thorough web archives. Captuing
the web since 1996, the publicly accessible [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) is one
of the best resources for viewing past websites.

The Internet Archive operates a `web crawler` that regularly searches and copies a large portion
of the web in frequent intervals to capture a fairly detailed snapshot of the web.

This requires Petabytes (that's 1 petabyte = 1,000,000 gigabytes)

Even with all that storage, they are only able to capture a shallow archive. It
would be impossible to make a exact copy of the web every hour..

---
class: middle center

Let's quickly browse the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org)

---
class: middle

Other web archives:
+ [Portugese Web Archive](https://arquivo.pt/?l=en)
+ [Icelandic Web Archive](https://vefsafn.is/index.php?page=english)
+ [UK Web Archive](https://www.webarchive.org.uk/)
+ [and many more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Web_archiving_initiatives)

And preservation projects:
+ [Restorativeland](https://restorativland.org/)
+ [GifCities](https://gifcities.org/)
+ [One Terabyte of the Kilobyte age](https://oneterabyteofkilobyteage.tumblr.com/)


---
class: middle

As great as it is what the Internet Archive and other sites are doing, it won't help us archive our own work...

It's hard to extract archives from the Internet Archive* so they
are not a reliable way for you to archive your work for personal&nbsp;keeping.

.footnote[<a href="https://github.com/hartator/wayback-machine-downloader">*but not impossible</a>]

---
class: middle

There are a bunch of great tools for preserving your websites.

Let's cover a few:
+ [archiveweb.page](https://archiveweb.page/)
+ [Conifer](https://conifer.rhizome.org)

And some more advanced/command line tools:
+ [httrack](https://www.httrack.com/)
+ [heritrix](https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Web-Archiving-Community)
+ [squidwarc](https://n0tan3rd.github.io/Squidwarc/)
+ [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)
+ [and many more...](https://github.com/iipc/awesome-web-archiving)

Utilizing all these approaches will cover you on all aspects, from being able to
show documentation (images, text), showcase functionality (video) and maintain a restageable version
of your site for a long time to come (web archive).

Speaking from experience, the hardest part of creating thorough documentation of
a project is *recognizing the need* at the time when everything is fresh in your
head and working as intended. There are a lot of projects I wish I could
go back and fix, but they are unfortunately lost to time.

This Pitchfork piece called [A Strange Visitor](https://webrecorder.io/_embed/m4rk3r/personal-work/20170425015744/http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/aphex-twin/) that I worked on is a simple example.
By the time I realized (years later) I should archive this project, it was too late.
The subscription for the fonts ran out, which were loading via adobe typekit.
