            <li>Create a document with the background of a hot pink color.</li>
            <li>Create a rectangle the size of a nickel, completely rounding one side and leaving the other squared off. Rotate this shape so that it is diagonal.</li>
            <li>Create a second identical shape that is diagonally rotated in the opposite direction. For both shapes, the rounded edge should be on the top.</li>
            <li>Allow both of the shapes to merge and overlap at the bottom half to create a small heart shape.</li>
            <li>Color the heart shape a deep pink, and create three more hearts for a total of four.</li>
            <li>Allow the hearts to move repeatedly from one corner to the other corner of the screen, moving back and forth at a somewhat quick pace, easing between areas. Make sure each heart has a different starting and ending point, and that they move at slightly different paces, but not differing in more than ten seconds. Allow them to move across the screen in a way that feels random, this can be of your choosing.</li>
            <li>Next, google the phrase “conversation hearts transparent background,” and go to google images. Choose what should be the fourth image, with a 6x4 grid of yellow, green, pink, purple, and blue hearts with red text on top. </li>
            <li>Crop out six hearts as their own individual images. Choose the blue heart with “true love” written on it, the green with “cutie pie,” the purple with “love you,” the yellow with “text me,” the pink with “xoxo,” and the orange with “you rock.”</li>
            <li>Make these six images roughly the same size as the heart shapes, and apply the same type of movements to the images as the heart shapes. Make sure that every heart and image move in a slightly different way, from different points on the screen.</li>
            <li>Then, add an out of focus blurred effect to both the images and the shapes. You should still be able to see that they are hearts, but the text on the images should be illegible.</li>
            <li>When you hover on either the shapes or the images, the movement should pause and the forms should be clear, ridding itself of the blur, and revealing text on the images.</li>
            <li>Finally, switch the background color and the color of the heart shapes with each other for when the window of the screen is at a size small enough to be a phone screen. </li>

            <li>For the first square on the left, choose a handful of colors that you find peaceful. Showcase all those colors by letting them fade into one another in the first square. </li>

            <li>Create a document with a gradient resembling the ocean - darker blue at the bottom and lighter blue at the top.</li>
            <li>Create ten circles with equal distances from each other.</li>
            <li>Make a radial gradient with colors of your choosing to fill the circles. </li>
            <li>Change the sizes of the circles so they’re all different - have larger circles next to smaller circles.</li>
            <li>Make the circles appear, and nearly disappear but not completely. </li>
            <li>Make the circles rise from the bottom to the top of the screen, looping continuously and disappearing from the top and bottom edges.</li>
            <li>Make sure each of the circles doesn’t rise up at the same time or appear/disappear in sync with each other. </li>
            <li>When the screen size is the width of an iPad (viewing horizontally) or smaller, adjust the sizes of the circles to make sure they still look like circles. Repeat this process when the screen size is the width of an iPhone or smaller. </li>
            <li>The end result should resemble bubbles rising underwater in each screen size.</li>

            <li>Create a document with a gradient background that goes from lavender to Blue (you can add pink as well if you like).</li>
            <li>Find an image of a butterfly online and animate that image so that it moves around the screen gently. </li>
            <li>Make the image fade out at the end of the animation. </li>
            <li>Repeat this process for 5 butterflies. </li>
            <li>Lastly, create a sparkle animation around the butterflies in random order. </li>
            <li>Use css animation to create the sparkle animation and it should fade in and fade out infinity. </li>

            <li>Open an html document and place a sunset gradient as the background.</li>
            <li>Create a circle towards the top of the page and in the center with the word ‘sunset’ in it. Make the circle light pink.</li>
            <li>Across the center of the page, create 5 circles placed randomly horizontally and vertically. The circles should be small, and should look like stars. Animate them fading in and out, switching between white, yellow, and light pink. The animation duration should be four seconds.</li>
            <li>Create a slightly larger circle that is dark orange at the top and center of the page. Have this circle, the sun, fade in as it travels down the page, reaching full opacity at the center. Have the sun fade out as it travels off the page. The animation duration should be 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>Create a white circle the same size as the fun, and create the same animation as before, but delayed by 5 seconds.</li>
            <li>Animate the background, choosing a darker color gradient to fade in when the moon is at the center, and a lighter color gradient when the sun is.</li>
