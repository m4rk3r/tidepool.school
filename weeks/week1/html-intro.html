# html tags
As you'll recall, html tags are designated with brackets wrapping a tag name:

![html tag](assets/html-tag.png)

The closing tag is prefaced with a `/` slash to indicate the tag is ending.

**note:** There are a few special "void" elements like an `<img>` tag that don't require a closing tag since they can't contain any content..

To start off an html document, we need to tell the browser that what we are making is actually
and html page:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
</html>
 ```

It's also good practice to specify what language your page will be in, for instance here I'll be using english:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
</html>
```

---

Inside our `html` tag we can add our foundational `head` and `body` tags:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

# comments
It can be really helpful to leave notes to yourself about what elements are, or how they work, for later reference.<BR>

```html
<!-- this is a comment -->
<header>
  <h1>My Page</h1>
</header>
```
Comments are made by starting with `<!--`
Anything after that, regardless of how many lines, won't be considered by the browser until you end it with: `-->`

**note:** comments will be visible to anyone viewing the source of  your html ; ~ )

# `block` and `inline` tags
There are two primary types of interaction for tags to keep in mind.

## block tags

Things like `div`, `p`, `section` etc.. `block tags` will take up the full width of the container, pushing other elements to be below them.
You can also set additional css attributes on them like `width` and `height`.

## inline tags

Are more often used within content, like: `span`, `a`, `strong` and other formatting tags that will flow with content instead of breaking it.

## The box model
Html elements are represented as a boxes, and these boxes have several properties you can
manipulate with css. The `padding`, `margin`, and `border` control how these boxes interact with neighboring elements.

## semantic html
Using tags that can indicate what kind of content they contain can be a useful way to improve the accessibility and parse-ability of your pages.

These tags that can confer extra meaning are called semantic tags.

class: middle

+ **core semantic elements**: `h1`-`h6`, `p`, `main`, `header`, `main`, `footer`, `nav`, `article`, `section`, `aside`, `blockquote`, `img`, `video`, `figure`...
```html
  <!-- these are some of the tags you'll use most often -->
  <h1>The heading tag</h1>
```
+ **general elements**: `div`, `span`
+ **lists**: ul, ol, dl
  ```html
      <h2>Types of Lists:</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>ul tag</dt>
        <dd>unordered lists (e.g. Â· bulleted lists)</dd>

        <dt>ol tag</dt>
        <dd>ordered lists (e.g. 1) 2) 3))</dd>

        <dt>dl tag</dt>
        <dd>the description list list.. meta</dd>
      </dl>
    ```

## links
  You can use anchor `<a>` tags to link to outside pages or to an element on the same page:
  ```html
  <!-- link to another page -->
  <a href="page-2.html">Go to page two</a>
  <!-- or to an element down the page -->
  <a href="#footnote">Go to the footnote</a>

  ...

  <!-- at the bottom of the page -->
  <footer id="footnote">a note about..</footer>

  <!-- or you can add prefixes to the href to create links that spawn an action depending on the browser and device -->
  <a href="mailto:myemail@gmail.com">contact me!</a>

  <!-- or on a mobile device..-->
  <a href="tel:123111111">Give me a call! ðŸ“ž</a>
  ```

  ## relative vs absolute links
  There are two ways to link to outside resources: `relative` and `absolute` links.

---
  #### absolute
  Absolute links point to the exact directory or location of the page you are linking to, e.g.
  ```html
  <!-- Note the `/` intial slash -->
  <a href="/my-website/pages/homepage.html">homepage</a>
  <a href="https://youtube.com/">Youtube</a>
  ```
  #### relative
  Relative links point to another page in relation to the current url:
  ```html
  <!-- this links to a pages/ folder within the same directory as the current file.. -->
  <a href="pages/homepage.html">homepage</a>
  <!-- the .. means go one directory up and then into the pages directory -->
  <a href="../pages/homepage.html">homepage</a>
  ```
  It's generally better to use absolute urls to ensure links wont break if the url setup changes

???
remember that the id's of elements must be unique!

  ## image, video, and audio tags
  There are special tags to incorporate images and other media types on your page:
  ```html
  <!-- the alt= property is to provide a description of the image -->
  <img src="/images/example.png" alt="My Example Image">
  ```
  or video:
  ```html
  <!-- attributes can be defined of the parent tag to control how the widget displays -->
  <video controls loop>
    <!-- multiple types can be supplied, and the browser will choose the best/supported version -->
    <source src="/videos/my-video.webm" type="video/webm">
    <source src="/videos/my-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <!-- you can also supply an optional fallback text when video isn't supported -->
    Sorry, it appears your browser doesn't support video.
  </video>
  ```
  or audio:
  ```html
  <!-- if there's only one source, the source can be supplied within the parent tag too -->
  <audio src="/songs/my-song.mp3" type="audio/mp3"></audio>
  ```
???
don't forget alt tags! they important for both seo and accessibility

  ## putting it all together
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <title>My new page</title>
    </head>
    <body>

    </body>
  </html>
  ```
    </textarea>
    <script src="/assets/js/remark-latest.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      var slideshow = remark.create({ ratio: '4:3', navigation: { scroll: false }});
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
