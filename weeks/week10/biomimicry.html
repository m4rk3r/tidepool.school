      <p class="brief">
        <mark>Brief:</mark> For our fourth lab project, you'll be creating a site that mimics a natural process.<BR>
        <mark>Due Date:</mark> Your assignment is due <strong class="underline">Thursday April 8th, *no later* than 8pm Eastern</strong> and must be <a href="mailto:beasleym@newschool.edu">emailed to me</a> by then or it will be considered incomplete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the natural world there are fascinating examples of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batesian_mimicry" target="_blank">various</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetics" target="_blank">forms</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry" target="_blank">mimicry</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the <mark>javascript</mark> we've learned in recent classes as well as <mark>CSS</mark>,
        you'll be creating a site that mimics a <em>natural process</em>.
        You can choose any process you like. Things like ice melting, a flower blooming, a sunrise, snow falling, a foggy window, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't worry about making something photo-realistic or overly-accurate, rather try to create a site that is unique, poetic, and impressionistic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's <a href="example/">an example</a> using the changing color of fall leaves and scroll events. This is just to get you thinking.. please don't make a variation of this <span class="rotate-90">: ]</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Your site should utilize at least one javascript event:
      </p>
      <ul id="events">
        <li>scroll</li>
        <li>mousemove</li>
        <li>mouseover/mouseout</li>
        <li>click</li>
        <li>load</li>
        <li>keydown/keyup</li>
        <li>touchdown/touchup (mobile)</li>
        <li>touchdown/touchup (mobile)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="https://tidepool.school/weeks/demo-js-and-dom/#23" target="_blank">Refer back to the slides</a> for a refresher.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have an idea but are unsure how to achieve it, please feel free to email or slack me.
        I would also like for you to write the javascript code you use. <u>Don't use code that you don't understand from online sources.</u>
        If you utilize code from a tutor or other resources, I want you leave comments in the code explaining what each line does and be able to explain it.
      </p>

      <h2>Grading & expectations</h2>
      <p>You will be graded on the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>submitted on time: Thursday April 8th, 8pm Eastern</li>
        <li>external css if using css</li>
        <li>valid html</li>
        <li>external javascript</li>
        <li>wrote your javascript code or left comments describing the functionality of code from other sources</li>
        <li>some activation with javascript events</li>
        <li>creativity and uniqueness</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Have fun with it, and I look forward to seeing your sites! üçÉ <span class="rotate-90">: )</span></p>
